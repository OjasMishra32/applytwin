# Scout jobs with ApplyTwin

1. `applytwin_scan_jobs` (scrapes the SimplifyJobs / community lists, the SmartRecruiters live feed, and ~500
   Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby and Workday boards; 1-3 minutes). Report new / matched counts.
2. `applytwin_list_jobs(limit=25, order="fit")` (or `order="new"` for "what's new"). Present a compact table:
   fit | company | title | location | ATS | job_id. Group by company when one company has many.
3. Point out the standouts: priority companies, postings under 24 hours old, anything with fit >= 85.
4. If results look wrong (too few, wrong roles, wrong level), adjust `search` in the profile with
   `applytwin_update_profile` (roles, include/exclude, locations, kind, season, min_fit) and rescan. Explain the change.
5. Offer next steps: "apply to the top N" (applytwin-apply) or "tailor for <id>" (applytwin-tailor).

## Watching
For "tell me the moment X posts": the user can run `applytwin watch --every 120` in a terminal (it polls the
fastest sources and sends a desktop notification). For a company ApplyTwin doesn't scrape yet, find its careers
page; if it's on Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby/SmartRecruiters/Workday, add the board slug to `~/.applytwin/companies.json`
(copy the shipped `data/companies.json` there first) and rescan.
